cubefield-2d
============

A game similar (and inspired by) the web game CubeField, but in 2 dimensions viewed top down.

This project was a request from my younger brother when I was taking an intro programming class and learning Swing GUI programming.  It has not been updated much since, so please forgive (and feel free to fix) sloppy code.

This repository contains the Eclipse project in Java for the project.  I didn't include the classpath since that will vary by system.  You will have to configure that yourself: in Eclipse right click on the project and select Build Path->Configure Build Path...  Then set it to use your default system Java library.
